This exercise involves creating fragments and attaching them to activities.

It is recommended that you complete this exercise as a guided tutorial by also downloading the 'solutions' project below and refer to it, as well as the other learning resources, when completing the tasks.

[Completed Project](https://git.cardiff.ac.uk/mobile-development/sample-projects/exercises/fragments)

This project also involves the use of some, potentially unseen APIs and resources in addition to those covered (or signposted to) in the slide decks. You are encouraged to explore the source code and resource files in the project, read any comments, and follow any signpost links.

### Supporting Learning Resources:

Before undertaking the tasks, you should look at the following resources as a minimum:

*	[App UI IV](https://git.cardiff.ac.uk/mobile-development/slide-decks/app-ui-fragments)

It is recommended that you also look at:

* [App UI I](https://git.cardiff.ac.uk/mobile-development/slide-decks/app-ui-i-views)
* [App UI II](https://git.cardiff.ac.uk/mobile-development/slide-decks/app-ui-events)
*	[Android App Anatomy](https://git.cardiff.ac.uk/mobile-development/slide-decks/anatomy)
*	[Activities](https://git.cardiff.ac.uk/mobile-development/slide-decks/activities)
*	[Android Studio](https://git.cardiff.ac.uk/mobile-development/slide-decks/android-studio)

### Tasks:

*T1* - Fetch this project using your preferred means (e.g., Check-out the project from Android Studio, git clone... using the command line, etc) and place it in your "Android Studio Projects folder". Open the project in Android Studio. **Note, after opening the project in Android Studio it may say "Error Loading Project" and the app will not run when the "Run" button is clicked. To fix this, go to File -> Sync Project with Gradle Files.**

*T2* - Complete the TODOs found throughout the project in order. Android Studio has a built-in tool that lists these and aids in navigating to their locations in the code - by default, this can be found as a tab along the bottom of the window.

### Extra Tasks:

*T3* - Take any project from a previous exercise that does not use fragments and convert it.
